# OpenAIexamples
Examples of using the OpenAI API

This intent of this project is to provide a series
of examples using the OpenAI API to access large 
language models such as ChatGPT in an automated fashion 
to better the management of forest resources.

The project will contain a series of Jupyter notebooks 
meant to be used in learning some of the features of the 
API and explore methods in how they can be used.
