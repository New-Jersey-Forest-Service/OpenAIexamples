Examples of using the OpenAI API
from the New Jersey Forest Service

This intent of this project is to provide a series
of examples using the OpenAI API to access large 
language models such as ChatGPT in an automated fashion 
to demonstrate how these toos could be used for tasks such
as automated reporting.

The project will contain a series of Jupyter notebooks 
meant to be used in learning some of the features of the 
API and explore methods in how they can be used.
