OpenAI recommends using the methods for setting up the key for all projects, setting up an environment variable locally, and calling it in code without including the key. This is not always practical, of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other recommended method involves setting up the key for a single project using a .env file that contains the key and calling that file from one's code. The documentation then recommends adding the .env file to .gitignore, if using git version control. This way the key is never included in the code or uploaded to a repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code used in this example is meant as a demonstration, so you can put your API key straight into the API_KEY constant listed at the beginning of this file with minimal setup and see how the interface works. NEVER save your key in this example or any code you are working on! If the file is copied or uploaded, you risk publicly exposing a paid API usage key."
